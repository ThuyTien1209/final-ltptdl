# Pathfinding Optimization using A star and Dijkstra Algorithm


## Summary

In this project, we set up two problems to apply A* and Dijkstra’s algorithms.
- Robot Vacuum Pathfinding (A*): A grid-based environment where a robotic vacuum must find an optimal route to clean dirty cells while avoiding obstacles. The algorithm uses a heuristic-driven search (Chebyshev distance) to minimize total movement and cleaning cost.
- Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph (Dijkstra) – A network of nodes (cities) where the goal is to find the shortest route between two points in a graph with positive edge weights. The algorithm uses a priority queue to iteratively relax edges and determine the minimum total distance.


## Skills and Technologies Used

### Programming & Development
- **Python** – Core programming language used for all implementations  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Designed modular classes (`Graph`, `Dijkstra`, `Node`, etc.)

### Analytical & Visualization Skills
- **Performance Evaluation** – Compared algorithm results in different scenarios
- **Visualization Design** – Developed intuitive interfaces for step-by-step algorithm execution


## Project Highlight

- Implemented both A* and Dijkstra algorithms in Python with a modular OOP structure.
- Developed an interactive GUI using Tkinter that allows users to:
  - Adjust input parameters/files
  - Visualize algorithm steps in real time.  
  - Control execution speed and view detailed information.
- Simulated pathfinding in two scenarios:
  1. Robot Navigation: Finding an optimal route in a 2D grid using the A* algorithm.  
  2. Weighted Graph: Finding the shortest route between cities using Dijkstra Algorithm.
