# Analysis and Application of the HDBSCAN Algorithm in Data Clustering


## Summary

In this project, we analyze and apply the HDBSCAN algorithm (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to the customer segmentation problem using the *Mall Customers* dataset from Kaggle.



## Skills and Technologies Used

### Programming & Data Processing
- **Python** – Core programming language for implementation.  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical computation.  
- **Scikit-learn** – Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding, and normalization).  
- **HDBSCAN** – Main clustering library for model implementation.

### Machine Learning & Analysis
- **Clustering Techniques:** HDBSCAN, DBSCAN, Mean Shift, K-Means, HAC.  
- **Feature Engineering** – Outlier handling, normalization (PowerTransformer + MinMaxScaler), and encoding.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** – Grid Search for min_samples, min_cluster_size, and epsilon.  
- **Model Comparison** – Evaluated across linear and nonlinear datasets.

### **Visualization & Evaluation**
- **UMAP** – Dimensionality reduction for 2D cluster visualization.  
- **Evaluation Metrics** – DBCV, Silhouette Score


## Project Highlight

- Study HDBSCAN Parameters and Operation Steps
- Compared HDBSCAN with the same approach algorithms (Mean Shift, DBSCAN) and different approach algorithms (k-Means, HAC) 
- Conduct data preprocessing and implement HDBSCAN on a real dataset.
- Use UMAP visualization to represent clusters in 2D, showing distinct and interpretable groups.
